Brief explanation of what our program does: ＜/br＞
Two players are allowed to play a tic-tac-toe game. Progrem will remind the player to enter the position they want to mark, and display the player's mark on the board. The two players take turns to mark. When the player marks a position that is repeated or out of the board, an error will be prompted and the player will be required to re-enter. The game ends automatically in 9 rounds.＜/br＞
